    <h2>A Day I Will Never Forget</h2>

    <div class="centerwholestory">

    <div class="storybody">Clayton and Brittany Cook were posing for their wedding photos in on a park bridge
         in Cambridge, Ontario, when the groom
        noticed a young boy was struggling in the nearby water, Canada’s CTV News reports.
         "I look over and I see Clay in
        the water and I think, what is he doing?" the bride told CTV Kitchener. Within seconds of
        noticing there was a child in danger, her husband had jumped into the river - in his wedding suit -
        to pull him on to dry land. “His face was underwater and he was fighting,
         like he was really fighting,” Clayton Cook said. “Luckily, he was only a little guy…and
        I honestly just sort of hopped him up.”</div>

    <div class="storybody"> To the couple and the wedding photographer, who captured the groom's heroic moment,
        it looked as though another child
        had pushed the boy in. Thankfully, he was okay and was taken home by an older sibling.</div>

    <div class="storybody">Following the dramatic photo session, photographer Darren Hatt shared two pictures of the unexpected rescue mission on
        his Facebook page. Many commenters have described Cook's efforts as "unbelievable" and "courageous". “It was a commendable
        thing that he did and he sprung into action incredibly quick,” Hatt said. “Almost as soon as I realised what was
        going on, he had already saved the day.”</div>

    <div class="storybody">As for Mrs Cook, she said her husband’s selfless actions are exactly why she married him. “That's Clay, like that's Clay
        to me,” she said. “It's something he would just instinctively do. It was like fate almost, we were meant to be there."
        It might have been a dramatic start to married life, but it sounds like these two are made for each other</div>
